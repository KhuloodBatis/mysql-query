# All right. For the moment, you know you have created only two triggers. But how could you prove that to someone who is seeing your 
# script for the first time?
# Well, in the ‘info’ section of the “employees” database, you can find a tab related to triggers. When you click on its name, 
# MySQL will show you the name, the related event, table, timing, and other characteristics regarding each trigger currently in use.  

# Awesome!

# Let’s introduce you to another interesting fact about MySQL. You already know there are pre-defined system variables, but system 
# functions exist too! 
# System functions can also be called built-in functions. 
# Often applied in practice, they provide data related to the moment of the execution of a certain query.

# For instance, SYSDATE() delivers the date and time of the moment at which you have invoked this function.
SELECT SYSDATE();

# Another frequently employed function, “Date Format”, assigns a specific format to a given date. For instance, the following query 

CREATE TRIGGER trig_ins_dept_mng
AFTER INSERT ON dept_manager
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
	DECLARE v_curr_salary int;
    
    SELECT 
		MAX(salary)
	INTO v_curr_salary FROM
		salaries
	WHERE
		emp_no = NEW.emp_no;

	IF v_curr_salary IS NOT NULL THEN
		UPDATE salaries 
		SET 
			to_date = SYSDATE()
		WHERE
			emp_no = NEW.emp_no and to_date = NEW.to_date;

		INSERT INTO salaries 
			VALUES (NEW.emp_no, v_curr_salary + 20000, NEW.from_date, NEW.to_date);
    END IF;
END $$

DELIMITER ;

# After you are sure you have understood how this query works, please execute it and then run the following INSERT statement.  
INSERT INTO dept_manager VALUES ('111534', 'd009', date_format(sysdate(), '%y-%m-%d'), '9999-01-01');

# SELECT the record of employee number 111534 in the ‘dept_manager’ table, and then in the ‘salaries’ table to see how the output was affected. 
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    dept_manager
WHERE
    emp_no = 111534;
    
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    salaries
WHERE
    emp_no = 111534;

# Conceptually, this was an ‘after’ trigger that automatically added $20,000 to the salary of the employee who was just promoted as a manager. 
# Moreover, it set the start date of her new contract to be the day on which you executed the insert statement.

# Finally, to restore the data in the database to the state from the beginning of this lecture, execute the following ROLLBACK statement. 
ROLLBACK;

# End.
